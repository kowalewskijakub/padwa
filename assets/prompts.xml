            Your task is to generate a summary of the provided text and determine whether the delivered text is
            irrelevant.

            Text is related to the Polish legal system.

            Text:
            {text}

            Assess the irrelevancy on a logical flag, where true means the text is irrelevant and false means the text
            is relevant.
            It is irrelevant if it is one of many:
            - an act or document concerning an individual person (e.g. the prime minister appoints a director),
            - a court judgment, administrative decision, or international agreement,
            - not a legal document at all (e.g. a newspaper article, a recipe).

            Respond with:
            1. Concise and straight to the point summary in Polish (200-300 words).
            2. Logical flag indicating whether the text is irrelevant (true/false).
